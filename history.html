<summary>Q: Where did tarot start?</summary>
<img src="history-pic2.jpg" class="imgright" width="390">
<p align="justify">The first known Tarot deck can be traced back to Italy in 1440. The Duke of Milan commissioned a painter to design a deck of playing cards for him, starting the "golden age of tarot", with rich aristocrats commissioning one-of-a-kind decks to reflect their personal interests.
    
Early tarot decks consisted of a regular 56-card deck combined with 22 personalized cards, for a total of 78 cards. They were originally used for game-playing among the elite.There is evidence that tarot was used for divination from early on in its history, but this was not a widespread practice until the 18th century.<br>
